Requires the Governor, Chief Justice, and Mayor of each county to designate at least one agency within their respective government unit as a converting agency responsible for converting government records into a disability-accessible format.  Establishes the process by which government records shall be converted into disability-accessible format upon request.  Allows the converting agencies to consult with the Disability Communications Access Board.  Requires the Office of Information Practices, Judiciary, and each county to adopt rules, regulations, or ordinances, including a provision that extends the time within which an agency must respond to requests for government records by 5 business days for records in disability-accessible formats, with exceptions for records pertaining to board meetings.  Appropriates funds."
